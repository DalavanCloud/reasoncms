To import a drupal site, use the standard drupal export functionality, which will create a
drupal eXtended RSS (WXR) file. Then, run drupal.php, which is probably located at this URL in 
your Reason instance:

http://your.host.name/reason/scripts/import/drupal/drupal.php

This tool was designed for drupal 3 - if the format remains consistent, it should work without updates.

If not, it won't.

While coded with the ambition to be generally useful, this imported was designed for a particular 
site, and that drupal extended RSS (WXR) file probably does not represent the complexity of other
drupal extended RSS files.

In short - I hope this works for your site but don't count your chickens.

If you make improvements to the importer that are generally helpful, I'd be happy to add your
changes to this tool. E-mail me - nate@natewhite.com.
